# Student Performance Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts a student’s math score (or overall performance) based on various input features. This project covers the entire pipeline—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment via a Flask web application.

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution built from scratch. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and web deployment. Users can input details such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The application then trains a model using this data (or uses a saved version from your latest training session) and generates a prediction based on the trained model.
