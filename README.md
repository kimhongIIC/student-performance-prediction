# Student Performance Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts a studentâ€™s math score based on various input features.

## Overview

This project provides a web-based interface for predicting student performance using a pre-trained machine learning model. Users can input details such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The application processes this data, applies the same preprocessing used during training, and then outputs a prediction.
